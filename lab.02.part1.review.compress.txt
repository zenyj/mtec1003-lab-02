http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Using a Terminal command that we learned, 
download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.
MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file:
----------

curl -o http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz
